## Visual SLAM project 
This is project i did as a part of my master thesis and my intrest in SLAM. 

## Libraries that i used or are useful in SLAM project or just needed  
### C++ 
1. Eigen - matrix operation library, similar to matlab, 
2. OpenCV - can't do computer vision without opencv, 
3. Pangolin - library for SLAM visualization based on OpneGL,  
4. Ceres / G2O - optimization libraries
5. matplotlibcpp

### Python 
1. OpenCV 
2. Numpy, Pandas 
3. Scikit / Scikit-image
4. G2O


## Useful materials, theory etc.
