# Visual SLAM project 

This is a project I did as a part of my master thesis and my intrest in SLAM. It's a Visual SLAM that uses mono or stereo camera. 

## How to install/compile 

## How to run 

## Libraries that i used or are useful in SLAM project  
### C++ 
1. Eigen - matrix operation library, similar to matlab, 
2. OpenCV - can't do computer vision without opencv, 
3. Pangolin - library for SLAM visualization based on OpneGL,  
4. Ceres / G2O/ GTSAM - optimization libraries
5. matplotlibcpp/matplot++ 
6. DBoW3/DBoW2 - bag of words for loop closing, BDoW3 is update to famous DBoW2, i made some changes to DBoW3 to make it work in C++17 and later
7. Open3D 

### Python 
1. OpenCV 
2. Numpy, Pandas 
3. Scikit / Scikit-image
4. G2O
5. Pangolin


## Useful materials, theory etc.
